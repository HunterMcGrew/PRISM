# Lessons

Append-only working memory for the dogfood install. Captures patterns from corrections, mistakes, and confirmed-good calls during work on PRISM itself — anything a future session would want to pick up without re-litigating.

## Format

One entry per pattern. Lead with the rule, then a `**Why:**` line (the trigger — usually a date and a one-line summary of what happened), and a `**How to apply:**` line (when the rule kicks in). Keep entries short — one sentence per line where possible.

```markdown
## Don't reach for X when Y is available

**Why:** 2026-05-02 — used X for Z and lost an hour debugging when Y would have done the same job in three lines.

**How to apply:** Check for Y first. Reach for X only when Y demonstrably can't carry the case.
```

Group related entries under topical headings. Update existing entries before adding new ones — duplicate lessons defeat the purpose.

## Scope

This file is for the **PRISM toolkit's own evolution** — patterns about how the build works, how the canonical sources behave, how the dogfood interacts with consumers. Team-side lessons (lessons a consumer team learns about their own codebase) belong in their own `.claude/lessons.md`, generated during onboarding.

## Why this file is otherwise empty

PRISM was extracted from a personal install of Thrive's `.claude/` toolkit. The original `lessons.md` carried 200+ lines of Thrive-specific corrections that don't apply outside Thrive. Phase 1 prune cleared them out. New lessons accumulate from PRISM development going forward.
