# Plan: epic-eve-substrate

> This epic adds Vercel eve as a compile/deploy target for PRISM's autonomous persona slice. The `.prism/` markdown directory stays the single source of truth — porting means extending `pnpm prism:build` with an eve emitter, not relocating the system.

## Ticket

https://github.com/HunterMcGrew/PRISM/issues/235

## Goal

Add a Vercel eve emitter to `pnpm prism:build` and port the autonomous persona slice (Lilac first, then Sage and Zoe) so they run as always-on, channel-driven eve agents orchestrated by Sol.

## Implementation Tasks

The work decomposes into six shippable **units**, ordered by dependency. Each unit is a lane Sol can fan out. The sequencing decision (hand-author Lilac in Unit A before extracting the emitter in Unit C) is load-bearing — see `## Decisions` § Sequencing.

- **Unit A** (Clove) — hand-author Lilac's eve agent directory as the runtime-validated reference. Blocks B.
- **Unit B** (Clove) — add `@ai-sdk/anthropic` + eve-output path definitions; the structural prerequisites for the emitter. Parallel with A.
- **Unit C** (Clove) — build the eve emitter in `build.ts`, extracted from Unit A's reference shape. After A and B.
- **Unit D** (Clove) — regenerate Lilac from the emitter; prove byte-identical to Unit A via a new test. After C. This is the emitter's correctness proof.
- **Unit E** (Clove) — extend the drift/cleanup/guard/seed machinery to cover eve output. After C.
- **Unit F** (Eli) — document the eve emitter and the Docker validation runbook. After D and E.

The Docker end-to-end validation of Lilac running on eve (`eve build && eve start`) is a **manual milestone**, not a unit — it needs Node 24 and cannot run in host CI. It is captured as a non-behavioral AC marked `[Docker / manual]`, not a Clove task.

### Clove (implementation)

#### Unit A — Hand-author Lilac's eve agent directory (reference artifact)

1. **Create the Lilac eve agent directory skeleton** at `.eve/agents/prism-standup-summary/`. This is a hand-authored reference, not generated output (Unit D later regenerates it and diffs against this). Create these files (full content in the sub-tasks below): `agent.ts`, `instructions.md`, `skills/prism-standup-summary/SKILL.md`, `schedules/standup.md`, `channels/slack.ts`, `channels/eve.ts`. Verification: none yet (no build wired) — this unit is validated by Unit D's diff and the Docker milestone.

2. **Write `agent.ts`** at `.eve/agents/prism-standup-summary/agent.ts` with direct-to-Anthropic routing:
   ```ts
   import { defineAgent } from "eve";
   import { anthropic } from "@ai-sdk/anthropic";

   export default defineAgent({
     model: anthropic("claude-sonnet-4.6"),
   });
   ```
   Direct routing (not the gateway string `"anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.6"`) is required so the agent runs off-Vercel on `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` with no AI Gateway — see `## Decisions` § Direct-to-Anthropic. Depends on Unit B task 7b (`@ai-sdk/anthropic` must be installed for this import to resolve).

3. **Write `instructions.md`** at `.eve/agents/prism-standup-summary/instructions.md` carrying Lilac's always-on identity. Content: the persona identity frame (the "You are **Lilac**…" opening paragraph from `.ai-skills/skills/prism-standup-summary/shared.md:1`) plus the `## Personality` and `## How Lilac Thinks` sections — the stable identity, not the procedural workflow. Do **not** include the procedural anti-pattern catalogue or the step-by-step standup workflow; those go in the skill body (task 4). The split rule: identity and voice → `instructions.md` (always-on); workflow and procedure → `skills/<id>/SKILL.md` (loaded on match). See `## Decisions` § Routing and context distribution.

4. **Write the skill** at `.eve/agents/prism-standup-summary/skills/prism-standup-summary/SKILL.md`. Frontmatter is a single `description` field — copy the `description` value from `.ai-skills/skills/prism-standup-summary/frontmatter.yml` verbatim (it already reads as a routing hint: "Lilac — standup scribe. Composes a 4-section Slack standup…"). Body: the procedural sections of `shared.md` (the standup workflow, the four-subsection rules, the Slack rendering contract, the anti-pattern catalogue) — everything that is *how to do the standup* rather than *who Lilac is*. The `description` is eve's only routing mechanism (verified) — it must be present and must read as a trigger hint, not a label.

5. **Write the schedule** at `.eve/agents/prism-standup-summary/schedules/standup.md` in markdown form:
   ```md
   ---
   cron: "0 13 * * 1-5"
   ---

   Compose today's standup from recent PR activity and post it to the team Slack channel after preview-and-confirm.
   ```
   `0 13 * * 1-5` is 13:00 UTC weekdays (cron is UTC on the schedule runner — verified against `docs/schedules.mdx`). The body must carry enough context to trigger the standup skill's `description` match (this is FR-3, the entry-point inversion — the schedule body is the turn content the model routes on). Schedules are root-only, which is why Lilac is a root agent (Option B).

6. **Write the Slack channel handler** at `.eve/agents/prism-standup-summary/channels/slack.ts`. Use eve's Slack channel (`import { slackChannel } from "eve/channels/slack"` — confirm the exact import path against `node_modules/eve/docs/channels/slack.mdx` at write time). The channel is the inbound surface and the HITL render target (approvals become Slack buttons). Gate the post: the standup-post action must be wrapped so it surfaces as an `always()` HITL approval before posting — Lilac's existing contract already requires preview-and-confirm (`shared.md:44-47`), so the gate expresses an existing rule, not a new one. See `## Decisions` § Idempotency.

7. **Write the eve HTTP channel** at `.eve/agents/prism-standup-summary/channels/eve.ts` with a local-world-safe auth array:
   ```ts
   import { eveChannel } from "eve/channels/eve";
   import { localDev, placeholderAuth } from "eve/channels/auth";

   export default eveChannel({
     auth: [localDev(), placeholderAuth()],
   });
   ```
   Omit `vercelOidc()` — slice 1 runs on loopback under `localDev()`, and `placeholderAuth()` fails closed so a misconfigured non-local deploy returns 401 rather than serving open. A real auth helper (`httpBasic`/`jwtHmac`/`oidc`) is required before any non-local deploy — see `## Decisions` § Auth (open-question variant). Verification for the whole unit: deferred to Unit D diff + Docker milestone.

#### Unit B — Structural prerequisites (parallel with A)

7b. **Add `@ai-sdk/anthropic` to dependencies.** It is not in the spike's deps and is required for direct-to-Anthropic routing (off-Vercel, no AI Gateway). Add it to the eve agent's own `package.json` context — since the eve agent runs under Node 24 in Docker (separate from the host build toolchain), the dependency belongs in the eve agent's dependency manifest, not necessarily the repo root `package.json`. Decide at implementation time whether slice 1 carries a dedicated `.eve/package.json` or reuses the root; if a dedicated manifest, pin `eve@^0.11.6`, `@ai-sdk/anthropic` (latest compatible), and `ai@7.0.0-beta.178` to match the spike (NFR-4 version containment). Verification: `pnpm install` (or the eve-scoped install) resolves without peer-dep errors.

8b. **Add eve path definitions** to `.ai-skills/definitions/paths.json` under `generated`: add `"eveAgentsRoot": ".eve/agents"`. This is the source of truth the emitter reads for its output dir, mirroring `claudeAgentsRoot` / `codexAgentsRoot` (paths.json:11-12). Verification: `pnpm prism:check-types` (the `pathDefinitions.generated.eveAgentsRoot` reference in Unit C task 9 must resolve against the type).

#### Unit C — Build the eve emitter in `build.ts` (after A and B)

8. **Add the `buildEveAgent` emitter functions** to `scripts/ai-skills/build.ts`, as siblings to `buildClaudeAgentMarkdown` (build.ts:211) and `buildCodexAgentToml` (build.ts:164). The emitter is a set of pure functions that take a persona's `SkillSource` (frontmatter map + shared body) plus the persona id and produce the eve agent directory's file contents — `instructions.md`, `skills/<id>/SKILL.md`, and (when the persona declares them in source) `schedules/` and `channels/` entries. Derive the identity/workflow split from Unit A's hand-authored Lilac: whatever content landed in Lilac's `instructions.md` vs `SKILL.md` is the split rule the emitter encodes. Match the existing emitters' header convention (`GENERATED_MARKDOWN_HEADER_LINE` for `.md`, the `<!-- Source / Target -->` comment block). Verification: `pnpm prism:check-types` (the new functions must type-check).

9. **Add an `eve` target to the `optedIn` gate and the per-skill loop** in `main()` (build.ts:1229 for `optedIn`, build.ts:1263 for the loop). Follow the `claudeAgents` pattern exactly: an `optedIn.eve` flag that is `!checkMode || (await eveAgentsRootHasManagedContent(targetRoots.eve))`, a `targetRoots.eve` entry resolved from `pathDefinitions.generated.eveAgentsRoot` (added in Unit B task 2), and a guarded write block inside the loop calling the Unit A emitter functions via `writeFileIfChanged`. **Gate eve emission to in-scope autonomous personas only** — not every skill is an autonomous-slice persona. Add the in-scope set as a constant (`EVE_AUTONOMOUS_PERSONAS = new Set(["prism-standup-summary"])` for slice 1; Sage and Zoe join in wave 2) and skip personas not in the set, mirroring how `roleDefinition.type !== "utility"` gates the agent-def emitters. Verification: `pnpm prism:build` runs without error.

10. **Add `eveAgentsRootHasManagedContent`** to `build.ts` as a sibling to `claudeAgentsRootHasManagedContent` (build.ts:700). It walks the eve agents root and returns true if any persona subdir carries the managed marker. The marker write happens per-persona inside the loop (like the Claude skills marker at build.ts:1309). Verification: covered by Unit E's drift test.

#### Unit D — Regenerate Lilac and prove byte-identical (after C)

11. **Run `pnpm prism:build`** and confirm it generates `.eve/agents/prism-standup-summary/` from canonical source. Then **diff the generated output against the Unit A hand-authored reference.** Because Unit A wrote the reference directly into `.eve/agents/prism-standup-summary/`, the regenerate step would overwrite it — so first **move the Unit A reference** to a fixture location `scripts/ai-skills/__fixtures__/eve-lilac-reference/` (as part of this task), then regenerate, then diff generated-vs-fixture. Zero diff is the emitter's correctness proof. If they differ, the emitter (Unit C) is wrong — fix Unit C, not the fixture. Verification: `diff -r .eve/agents/prism-standup-summary scripts/ai-skills/__fixtures__/eve-lilac-reference` returns empty.

12. **Write the emitter test** at `scripts/ai-skills/eve-emitter.test.ts` following the shape of `claude-agent-def.test.ts`. Assert: (a) the emitter produces an `instructions.md` containing Lilac's identity frame and *not* the standup workflow; (b) the `SKILL.md` frontmatter carries a non-empty `description`; (c) the generated directory tree byte-matches the `__fixtures__/eve-lilac-reference` fixture. Test runs on host Node (no eve runtime needed — it asserts directory shape, not behavior). Verification: `pnpm prism:test` passes; confirm the new test is picked up by the `scripts/ai-skills/*.test.ts` glob.

#### Unit E — Extend drift, cleanup, guard, and seed machinery (after C)

13. **Add eve-output cleanup** by calling `removeDeletedManagedAgentFiles` (or a directory-aware analogue) for the eve agents root in `main()`, alongside the existing calls at build.ts:1511-1522. Because eve output is a *directory* per persona (not a single `.md`/`.toml` file), the cleanup must remove a whole persona subdir whose canonical source no longer exists or whose persona left the `EVE_AUTONOMOUS_PERSONAS` set. Model it on `removeDeletedManagedSkills` (directory-based) rather than `removeDeletedManagedAgentFiles` (file-based). Verification: `pnpm prism:test` — add a cleanup case to the emitter test asserting a removed persona's eve dir is swept.

14. **Add the eve agents root to the literal-guard roots** list in `main()` (build.ts:1524). The eve output is generated and must not carry non-tokenized Thrive-flavored literals, same as every other platform output. Verification: `pnpm prism:build` (the literal guard runs as part of it); if Lilac's source carries a literal, tokenize the canonical source or allowlist per the existing flow.

15. **Classify the eve output in `seed-curation.json`** at `.ai-skills/definitions/seed-curation.json`. The `.eve/` tree is a *generated platform output*, not canonical `.prism/` content — confirm whether the seed mirror (`writeSeedMirror`, which only walks `COPIED_CONTENT_AREAS` under `.prism/`) even touches it. It does **not** (eve output is under `.eve/`, not `.prism/`), so no seed-curation entry is needed — but add a one-line comment in the plan-referenced spot confirming the decision so a future reviewer doesn't re-ask. Verification: `pnpm prism:check` passes (no seed drift reported for eve output). If `prism:check` reports the eve tree as unclassified, that is the signal it *is* being walked and needs an `excluded` entry — handle that case if it arises.

16. **Decide the gitignore posture for `.eve/`** and update `.gitignore`. Follow the per-tool ownership rule (ADR-0044, install-layout § Direct-write tool outputs): the eve agents root is a generated, in-repo destination → **committed** (like `.cursor/skills/`), so a consumer gets it via `git pull`. Add `.eve/worktrees/` to the ignored set (operational state, like the other tools' worktrees at .gitignore:11-13). Verification: `git status` shows the generated `.eve/agents/` as tracked and any worktree dir as ignored.

### Eli (documentation)

#### Unit F — Document the emitter and the Docker runbook (after D and E)

17. **Update `.prism/architect/_toolkit/install-layout.md`** to add the eve emitter to the platform-output inventory. Add `.eve/agents/<persona>/` to the "Platform-specific outputs" list (install-layout.md:10) and a short subsection under "What gets copied; what stays canonical-only" (install-layout.md:41) explaining that eve output is generated per-persona from `.ai-skills/skills/<id>/` (like the other agent defs) and is gated to the autonomous-slice persona set. Cite ADR-0062. Verification: `pnpm prism:crossref-lint` passes (any new repo-root-absolute references resolve).

18. **Write the Docker validation runbook** at `.prism/architect/_toolkit/eve-runtime.md` (new file). Content: the manual milestone steps to run Lilac on eve — `node:24` Docker container, `pnpm install` (with `@ai-sdk/anthropic`), `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` env, `eve build`, `eve start`, hit the dev-trigger route `POST /eve/v1/dev/schedules/standup`, confirm the standup composes and the Slack-post HITL gate fires. Note the Node-floor split (emitter on host 22, runtime on Docker 24) and that this is a manual milestone, not CI. Add the manifest route for the new doc in `.prism/architect/manifest.json` (key `.eve/**` or `scripts/ai-skills/build.ts` → add `eve-runtime.md`) so future eve-emitter edits load it. Verification: `pnpm prism:verify-manifest` and `pnpm prism:crossref-lint` pass.

## Decisions

- **Sequencing: hand-author Lilac first (Unit A), then extract the emitter (Unit C), then regenerate-and-diff (Unit D) — not emitter-first.**
  - **Root cause of the choice:** eve is a beta runtime no one on the team has a working example of. Writing the emitter first encodes *assumptions* about eve's directory shape into TypeScript, discovered wrong only when `eve build` rejects the output inside Docker (Node 24, slow loop).
  - **Alternatives considered:** emitter-first (Parker's suggestion); hand-author-only (no emitter this epic); hand-author-first-then-extract (chosen).
  - **Chosen approach:** hand-author Lilac's agent dir as a runtime-validated reference, extract the emitter from it, then regenerate Lilac and byte-diff against the reference. Beats emitter-first because it produces a known-good artifact validated against the real runtime *before* generalizing, and turns the emitter's correctness proof from a Docker-gated integration question into an on-host byte-diff. Beats hand-author-only because the emitter is the whole point (FR-1) and extracting it from a concrete example is lower-risk than authoring it abstract.
  - **Implementation guidance:** Unit A writes into `.eve/agents/prism-standup-summary/`; Unit D moves it to `__fixtures__/eve-lilac-reference/` before regenerating so the diff has something to compare against.
  - → promoted to ADR-0062 (the sequencing rationale is summarized in Consequences; the full reasoning lives here in the plan as ticket-tactical depth).

- **Routing and context distribution: persona `description` → eve skill `description` (verbatim); identity → `instructions.md`, workflow → `skills/<id>/SKILL.md`.**
  - **Root cause:** eve routes to skills by `description` only — there is no static event→skill dispatch table (verified against `docs/skills.mdx`). And eve does not auto-load shared context across an agent — `instructions.md` is the only always-on surface.
  - **Chosen approach:** map PRISM frontmatter `description` straight onto the eve skill `description` (PRISM's already reads as a trigger hint). Split `shared.md` by kind: identity/voice/personality → always-on `instructions.md`; procedure/workflow/anti-patterns → on-match `SKILL.md`. Tier-1 always-on rules, when a persona needs them, also go in `instructions.md` (per-skill siblings are for on-demand reference content the workflow reads, not always-on rules).
  - **Implementation guidance:** the identity/workflow split is established concretely in Unit A (Lilac) and the emitter (Unit C) encodes whatever split landed there. Pre-emit check: the emitter asserts every emitted `SKILL.md` carries a non-empty `description` (FR-2) and fails the build if one is missing.
  - → promoted to ADR-0062 § Decision 1–2 and the install-layout doc (Unit F task 17).

- **Idempotency (Open Q2): defer the general layer; gate each side effect behind eve HITL `always()` in the meantime.**
  - **Root cause:** eve re-runs a step interrupted mid-execution, so a non-idempotent side effect caught mid-`execute()` by a crash fires twice (verified). Completed steps never re-run, so the risk is narrow.
  - **Alternatives considered:** build a general idempotency layer now (dedup keys / check-before-act); gate behind HITL (chosen); do nothing.
  - **Chosen approach:** gate every in-scope side effect behind `needsApproval: always()`. For Lilac (slice 1) the only side effect is the Slack post, and her existing contract already requires explicit preview-and-confirm — so the gate is her existing rule in eve's primitive, not new friction. A general idempotency layer earns its place only when a persona has a side effect that *shouldn't* require approval on every run.
  - **Implementation guidance:** Unit A task 6 wraps the Slack-post action in the `always()` gate. The general layer is the resolver's call when the first such persona ships (Winston).
  - → promoted to ADR-0062 § Decision 6.

- **OPEN — TBD, needs Winston (wave-2 plan) input.** State-location design for FR-4 (Open Q3): the concrete clone → read → commit → (push?) flow for a persona operating on `.prism/` state inside the sandbox, and where idempotency gates the push. **Default path (used until resolved):** unspecified beyond the PRD surface description; slice 1 (Lilac) does not exercise it — her inputs come from the GitHub API and her output is a Slack post, neither of which touches `.prism/` repo state. The design lands when the first repo-state persona (Sage: reads tags/commits; or Zoe: reads `.prism/` plans) is built in wave 2. The push step is exactly where the deferred idempotency problem bites hardest, so the FR-4 design and the Q2 general-idempotency layer resolve together.

- **OPEN — TBD, needs the first non-local deploy as the trigger (resolver: Winston/Hunter at deploy time).** Production auth helper for the eve session routes. **Default path (used until resolved):** slice 1 runs entirely on loopback under `localDev()`, with `placeholderAuth()` failing closed behind it (Unit A task 7). `vercelOidc()` is omitted because the no-Vercel-lock-in goal means we must not rely on it alone. The first non-local deploy is the trigger to choose `httpBasic` / `jwtHmac` / `jwtEcdsa` / `oidc` / a custom `AuthFn`; under Option B, the receiving persona agent's auth walk must accept whatever outbound auth Sol presents (`bearer` / `basic` / OIDC).

- **Direct-to-Anthropic routing requires adding `@ai-sdk/anthropic` (not in the spike's deps).** The spike uses the gateway-routed model string, which needs `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` off-Vercel. Direct routing (`anthropic("…")` + `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`) is required for the no-Vercel-lock-in goal, so `@ai-sdk/anthropic` is a real install task (Unit B), pinned alongside `eve@^0.11.6` per NFR-4. → promoted to ADR-0062 § Decision 5.

- **Verification split: the emitter is CI-green on host Node; running Lilac on eve is a manual Docker milestone.** The emitter is TypeScript in `build.ts` — its correctness is proved on host Node 22 by the Unit D byte-diff and the Unit D test, both in CI via `pnpm prism:check`. Actually running the agent (`eve build && eve start`) needs Node 24 → Docker `node:24`, which the host CI (Node 22) cannot run — so the end-to-end proof is a manual milestone captured as a `[Docker / manual]` AC, never a CI gate. → promoted to ADR-0062 § Decision 7. No CI AC requires Node 24.

- **Eve output lives under `.eve/agents/<persona>/`, committed, following the per-tool ownership rule (ADR-0044).** It is a generated in-repo destination → committed (like `.cursor/skills/`); `.eve/worktrees/` is ignored (operational state). It is not canonical `.prism/` content, so the seed mirror does not walk it and no `seed-curation.json` entry is needed (Unit E task 15 confirms). → no promotion needed (codified in install-layout.md via Unit F task 17 and follows existing ADR-0044).

- **Scope: autonomous slice only (Lilac → Sage → Zoe); the emitter gates emission to an explicit persona set.** The build loop (Winston/Clove/Briar) is not ported. Eric-via-GitHub-webhook is a documented wave-2 candidate, deferred because the GitHub channel's pre-call checkout requires the Vercel backend, conflicting with the local-world goal. → promoted to ADR-0062 § Decision 3.

## History

- 2026-06-19 [hmcgrew/eve-substrate-port]: Created epic branch plan and issue #235.
- 2026-06-19 [hmcgrew/eve-substrate-port]: Winston added the architecture, ADR-0062, and the implementation plan. Verified all 14 load-bearing eve runtime claims against the actual docs before relying on them; decomposed into six units (A: hand-author Lilac, B: prereqs, C: emitter, D: regenerate+diff, E: drift/guard/seed, F: docs). Resolved Open Q2 (idempotency → HITL gate default) and Q3 (state-location → wave-2 open variant); see Decision: Sequencing for the Lilac-by-hand-first call.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Behavioral

**Background:** PRISM's canonical persona source lives in `.ai-skills/skills/`, and `pnpm prism:build` regenerates all platform outputs from it.

- [ ] When the build runs, Then an eve agent directory is produced for each in-scope autonomous persona (Lilac for slice 1), containing an always-on identity file, a skill with a routing description, a schedule, and channel configuration.
- [ ] When the eve agent directory is produced, Then its skill carries a non-empty routing description (the build fails if any emitted skill is missing one).
- [ ] When a persona is removed from the autonomous-slice set and the build runs, Then that persona's eve agent directory is swept and no orphan remains.
- [ ] Given the hand-authored Lilac reference exists, When the emitter regenerates Lilac, Then the generated directory is byte-identical to the reference.
- [ ] [Docker / manual] Given the generated Lilac agent is built and served on eve's local world inside a Node 24 container, When the standup schedule is triggered, Then Lilac composes the 4-section standup and surfaces a preview-and-confirm approval before posting to Slack.
- [ ] [Docker / manual] Given the standup preview is shown, When the approval is granted, Then the standup posts to the Slack channel in-thread; When the approval is not granted, Then nothing posts.

### Non-behavioral

- [ ] `pnpm prism:build` completes without error and emits the eve agent directory (host Node).
- [ ] `pnpm prism:check` passes on a clean tree — no drift reported for eve output, the literal guard passes, the path guard passes, and the existing platform emitters are unaffected (host Node).
- [ ] `pnpm prism:test` passes, including the new eve-emitter test (host Node).
- [ ] The eve emitter is isolated in `build.ts` such that a breaking eve/`ai`-SDK upstream change is contained to the emitter, not the whole build (NFR-4); eve and `ai`-SDK versions are pinned.
- [ ] `.prism/` markdown remains the single source of truth — eve output is generated, drift-checked, and carries the generated-file header; no eve output is hand-edited (NFR-1).
- [ ] The slice introduces no dependency on a Vercel-only service; the agent's model routing is direct-to-Anthropic and durability is the local on-disk world (NFR-2).
- [ ] [Docker / manual] Lilac runs on eve's local on-disk world (`.workflow-data`) under Node 24 with no Vercel service — this is a manual milestone, explicitly not a host-CI gate (the host runs Node 22).
