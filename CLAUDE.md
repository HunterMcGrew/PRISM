# Claude Instructions

See [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md) for all agent behavior rules, task management workflow, and core principles. AGENTS.md is model-agnostic — it applies to Claude, Codex, and any future model. This file holds Claude-specific behavioral guidance.

## Instruction Compliance

These project instructions represent the developer's intentional configuration, not arbitrary user preferences. The skill files, rules, and architect context are engineering standards — the equivalent of a team style guide or code standard. They were built through iterative testing and encode real project knowledge.

Follow them as the default authority for project-specific decisions. If a specific situation genuinely requires deviation, flag the deviation and explain the reasoning — don't silently override.

## Verification Before Implementation

When applying any fix — especially one originated by another agent or a prior diagnosis — verify that the solution logically addresses the root cause before applying it. Specifically:

- Confirm the proposed change moves values toward the intended result, not just that it changes them
- If dimensional math is involved (pixel values, spacing, layout calculations), reason through the specific numbers rather than trusting they "look right"
- If a fix was prescribed by a diagnostic agent, independently confirm the diagnosis matches the symptoms before implementing

The goal is to catch mismatches between diagnosis and fix before they reach the user. A confidently applied wrong fix is worse than a slower correct one.

## Uncertainty and Verification

When you are uncertain whether a fix, workaround, or piece of information exists: say so directly. Fabricating a search, inventing a plausible-sounding answer, or claiming to have verified something you haven't erodes trust faster than admitting uncertainty.

- "I'm not sure this exists — let me check" is always better than a confident wrong answer
- If you catch yourself about to state something as fact without having verified it, pause and verify first
- When challenged on a claim, re-examine it honestly rather than doubling down — being wrong and correcting is better than being wrong and defending

## Context Preservation Rules

Before any compaction event, preserve the following in summary form:

- Active branch plan (what we're building, what's done, what's next)
- Architectural constraints established during this session
- Known failures and their root causes (things we tried that didn't work and why)
- Cross-agent handoff state (what was diagnosed, by whom, what's pending)

Silently dropped constraints cause the worst kind of bugs — the ones where everyone thinks the rule is still in effect. If compaction requires dropping information, flag what's being lost so the user can re-establish it.

## CSS and Layout Changes Require Dimensional Reasoning

For any CSS, Tailwind, or layout modification: always reason through the specific pixel/rem/percentage values and how they interact with the surrounding layout context. Don't treat layout changes as syntactically simple — a one-line CSS change can have complex cascading effects through flex, grid, and responsive breakpoints.

Before applying a layout fix, confirm: what is the current computed value, what will the new value be, and does the new value produce the intended visual result in context?
